# Installation Requirements

* Windows 10

* [Unity 2020.1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). We recommend installing the latest version of Unity 2020 via the Unity Hub; 2020.1 is the minimum.

* Optional: To run the PySide2 example, you will need the [PySide2](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_Python) package (see below).

## Windows

Install Unity Hub and Unity 2020 in their default locations. Then proceed to install the Python for Unity package.
Open Unity's [Package Manager](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui.html) window and look for the package `Python for Unity`.
Install it. Once the installation process is over, a message displaying "Python sucessfully installed" should appear in the Console.
 

To get PySide2 after installing Python for Unity, start a PowerShell session from the [Settings](settings.md) and run:

```shell
pip install PySide2
```
